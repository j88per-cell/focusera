## About

**Focusera** is a self-hosted photography and art platform that empowers photographers and artists to present their work without being at the mercy of social media algorithms.

Built on the popular **Laravel** framework, it can run on a wide variety of hosting providers. Popular cloud platforms such as **AWS**, **Hetzner**, and **DigitalOcean** are recommended.

### Features

-   üé® **Customizable Themes**  
    Show your artistic flair with fully customizable themes to control how your work is presented.

-   üîê **Passwordless Login (OTP)**  
    Simple, secure logins using one-time passwords. More secure and convenient than traditional passwords. And nothing to remember.

-   üñºÔ∏è **Public & Private Galleries**  
    Share galleries via short 6-digit codes, making it easy to control who has access to specific galleries

-   üñ®Ô∏è **Print Ordering with Print on Demand services** (Coming soon)
    On-demand print fulfillment. Set your own markup and begin taking orders quickly.

    **Nested galleries**
    You can nest galleries inside galleries as deep as you want.

    **Photo uploads**
    Automatically resize for thumbnail and web sizes defined in settings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   PHP 8.3+
-   Composer 2.6+ (see dependency notes below)
-   Node.js 18+
-   MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, or SQLite (details below)
-   Redis (optional, used for improving site performance with caching)

#### Database compatibility

-   **MySQL / MariaDB**: Laravel 10 requires MySQL 8.0.21+ or MariaDB 10.3.27+. We actively test on MySQL 8.4 LTS and MariaDB 10.11.
-   **PostgreSQL**: Tested on PostgreSQL 16 and higher.
-   **SQLite**: SQLite 3.26+ is required; development smoke tests are run on SQLite 3.45.

#### Sample `.env` for PostgreSQL

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=focusera
DB_USERNAME=focusera
DB_PASSWORD=secret

# Optional: queue & cache connections when running Redis alongside PostgreSQL
CACHE_STORE=redis
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
SESSION_DRIVER=database
```

#### Composer requirements

The core application depends on the packages below (see `composer.json` for the full list):

-   `laravel/framework` `^10.10` and related first-party packages such as `laravel/breeze`, `laravel/sanctum`, and `laravel/tinker`.
-   Image handling stack: `spatie/image` `^3.8` and `spatie/image-optimizer` `^1.8`.
-   Supporting utilities including `filp/whoops` `^2.18`, `guzzlehttp/guzzle` `^7.2`, `inertiajs/inertia-laravel` `^0.6.8`, and `kalnoy/nestedset` `^6.0`.

Make sure your PHP version satisfies the `^8.3` platform requirement so Composer can resolve these packages.

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd focusera

composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# configure database credentials in .env

php artisan migrate
php artisan db:ensure
php artisan db:seed

npm install
npm run dev
```

-   `php artisan db:ensure` keeps required baseline records (currently default site settings) in place across environments. Pass `--only=settings` to target just the settings group or re-run it any time after config changes.

Seeding populates:

-   Core roles (Viewer, Contributor, Admin)
-   `site.theme.active` ‚Äì active frontend theme (auto-detected in the admin UI)
-   Feature toggles (news, featured galleries, sales/cart/order flow)
-   Sales/provider placeholders so they can be edited from the admin without touching `.env`

### Configuration & Admin Setup

-   Log in using the OTP flow (enter an email for an existing user; OTP is mailed via the configured driver).
-   To create the initial admin account, browse directly to `/register` (no menu link). The very first user is automatically assigned the **Admin** role. After one user exists, self-registration is disabled and `/register` returns 403.
-   Ongoing user registration isn‚Äôt available, an admin can invite additional teammates (editors, photographers, etc.) via **Admin ‚Üí Users** and assign roles on the fly.
-   Navigate to **Admin ‚Üí Settings** to manage:
    -   **Site ‚Üí theme ‚Üí active**: theme selector auto-populates from `resources/js/Themes/*`.
    -   **Site ‚Üí photoproxy**: toggle PHP-based delivery for web-resolution images (thumbnails stay as direct `<img>` tags).
    -   **Site ‚Üí security**: manage bot/spider access to the photoproxy (blocked agents, regexes, IPs, header requirements).
    -   **Site ‚Üí storage ‚Üí public/private disk**: choose Laravel filesystem disks (local, S3, Backblaze, etc.) for web and private assets.
    -   **Features**: toggle sales/cart, news, featured galleries.
    -   **Sales**: choose provider, toggle sandbox, set API endpoints/keys.
-   Use **Admin ‚Üí Users** to invite teammates by email and assign roles‚Äîno passwords are required, invited users authenticate through the OTP flow.

When enabling the **Sales** feature, the Orders menu, cart API, and ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù buttons light up automatically via feature gating‚Äîno route cache flush needed.

### Built-in Privacy-Friendly Analytics

Focusera ships with lightweight, privacy-first analytics:

-   **Session-based tracking** using server side sessions (no cookies, no raw IPs stored).
-   **Queued event logging** for page views, private gallery access, conversions, and custom events.
-   **Automatic charts** on the admin dashboard (sessions, page views, device split, top galleries/photos, bounce rate, etc.).
-   **Settings-driven** via **Site ‚Üí analytics** (enable/disable, capture referrer, optional geo).

#### Running the queue worker

Analytics writes are dispatched to the background queue. Be sure to run a worker:

```bash
php artisan queue:work --queue=analytics
```

For production deployments, configure a Supervisor job, for example:

```
[program:focusera-analytics]
command=/usr/bin/php /var/www/focusera/artisan queue:work --queue=analytics --sleep=3 --tries=1
directory=/var/www/focusera
autostart=true
autorestart=true
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/var/log/focusera/queue.log
```

Restart Supervisor after adding the config (`sudo supervisorctl reread && sudo supervisorctl update`).

## Roadmap / TODO

-   **Search**: Add database-agnostic full-text search (PostgreSQL `tsvector` / SQLite FTS / MySQL FULLTEXT fallback) for photos and galleries.
-   **Print on Demand**: Multiple POD services to choose from.
